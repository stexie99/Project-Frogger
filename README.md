Milestone Project 1
This is inspired by the classic 1981 game Frogger. To play this game, use the arrow keys to move the frog accross the road and pond for 1 point. If the player gets hit by a car or falls in water, they will lose a life. To win, score 5 points, but make sure your frog is healthy because the game is over when the number of lives falls under 0.
