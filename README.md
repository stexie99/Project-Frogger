## Milestone Project 1- Frogger Imitation 

This web game made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is inspired by the classic 1981 game Frogger. To play this game, use the arrow keys or WASD to move the frog across the road and pond for 1 point. The player starts with 5 lives, if the player gets hit by a car or falls in water they will lose a life. To make it across, avoid the cars and step on the logs. To win, score 5 points, but make sure your frog is healthy because the game is over when the number of lives falls under 0.

## Features currently under the works: 
1. frog animation
2. randomized car sprites
3. adding extra lives players can collect
4. adding a time limit
